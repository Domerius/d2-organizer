# D2 Organizer

## Objective
Create a program that suggests the optimal order for completing group raid achievements in Destiny 2, based on a pool of achievements entered into the program, which are associated with group members who are missing them.

## Criteria
- User's confort
- Time and memory efficiency
- Scalability
  
## Summary
This application is being developed in order to enhance my personal coding skills in C++ and practice using selected language features. Maybe also to organize the group more efficiently :)

## Functionality
The program should allow for manual data entry and automatic deletion when certain conditions are met. Data should be saved between program runs in a file of any format. A simple terminal command should be able to generate a report that presents a suggested ranking of activities for the group to complete the next Saturday evening. In later stages of development, I plan to add filtering and additional personalization options. In the future, I plan to transform the app into a Discord bot to enhance integration with the group.
